    "## Revisiting Functions\n",
    "We have been using functions quite often now, each one for a particular purpose. So you should already know that a function performs a specific task. Some examples of functions that we have used: `print()`, `input()`, `random.randint()` etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **function** is basically a **named, reusable sequence of statements** that performs some useful operation. In other words, it is a bunch of code that's given a name. In addition to the built-in functions provided by a programming language, we can define our own functions. Functions allow us to reuse our code, making writing a program easier and faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anatomy of a Function Definition\n",
    "Let's learn the basic syntax of **defining** a function. It should have the following form:\n",
    "```py\n",
    "def func_name(params1, params2):\n",
    "    # indented function body here\n",
    "    # code that runs whenever function is called\n",
    "    print(\"something\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first line (the function signature), we need:  \n",
    "1. The **`def`** keyword to tell Python that we are creating a new function. \n",
    "2. Followed, after a space, by the **function name**, which follows the same rules as variable names - must be a single word and start with a letter.\n",
    "3. Followed immediately by round **brackets**, with optional **parameter variables to specify arguments** needed to call the function (more on this later).\n",
    "4. Followed by a **colon** (**`:`**) to indicate a following indented body of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **indented (TAB) function body** starts in the next line after the colon. It contains the code that will run every time the function is called. It can contain as many statements as you want, including if statements, loops, variables, conditions, math operators, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters and Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "We can pass information into a function by using parameters and arguments. While both parameters and arguments refer to the same information that is being passed into the function, their definitions from the function's perspective is different.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **parameter** is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **argument** is the value that is sent to the function when it is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the function - by **calling** it\n",
    "\n",
    "We only need to define a function once, after which, we can **reuse** it any number of times just by **calling** it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As we have done many times already, we can call a function simply by typing its name followed by brackets, containing arguments if required.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: The number of arguments **MUST** match the number of parameters when the functions is being defined.\n"

    "Coupled with increasing availabilty of high-speed networks and low-cost computers and storage devices, the widespread adoption of hardware virtualisation and service-oriented architecture has led to rapid growth in cloud computing over the decade.\n",

    "### The Advantages of Cloud Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many benefits to using cloud computing in our application and here is a non-exhaustive list of advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><b>Highly Available</b>: Users can access the cloud whenever and wherever, as long as they are connected to the Internet.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Scalable Resources</b>: Users can easily select different computer resources to meet their needs (<i>eg. provisioning more computing resources for an ecommerce website during a holiday sales to accommodate the spike in customer visits.</i>)</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Flexible Pricing Model</b>: Rather than spending a huge amount of money to set up physical servers, users can choose to pay according to the provisioned resources.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Fast Deployment</b>: While setting up physical servers can take weeks or even months to complete, deploying applications on the cloud can be achieved in mere seconds.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Readily Available IT Support</b>: Cloud service providers would often have a team of professional IT support that helps to solve any technicaly issues that occur so business owners don't have to invest too heavily on their own team of IT professionals. </li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Easier Collaboration</b>: Cloud services have made collaboration of contributors across the globe possible. As long as the Internet is available, anyone from anywhere can make changes to the same document in the cloud storage. </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",

    "\n",
    "<b>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</b> was created as a subsidiary under Amazon in July 2002, with the goal to \"enable developers to build innovative and entrepreneurial applications on their own\". The products that pioneered the usage of server virtualisation are <b>AWS Simple Storage Service (S3)</b> and <b>AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)</b>, allowing users to virtually provision computer resources through the Internet. \n",

Compared to the other cloud service providers, AWS has taken up 32% of the market share as of Q4 2020 as shown in the infographic below:<br>\n",

Each region is wholly contained within a single country and all of its data and services stay within the designated region. These regions have multiple \"Availability Zones\" and each of these Zones houses one of more discrete data centers. All data centers are equiped with redundant power, networking and connectivity, and they are intentionally isolated from each other to prevent potential outages from spreading between zones.\n",

    "**Machine learning (ML)** is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on building applications that learn from data and improve their accuracy over time without being programmed to do so. **Artificial intelligence** refers to the ability of a computer or machine to mimic the capabilities of the human mind—learning from examples and experience, recognizing objects, understanding and responding to language, making decisions, solving problems—and combining these and other capabilities to perform functions a human might perform, such as greeting a hotel guest or driving a car.\n",

    "Some examples of machine learning in our daily lives are:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>digital assistants like Siri and Alexa that searches the web and play music in response to our voice commands</li>\n",
    "    <li>messaging services automatically predicts your next word as you type based on past data of how you have been sending messages</li>\n",
    "    <li>websites such as Amazon and Netflix recommending products, movies and songs based on what we bought, watched, or listened to before</li>\n",
    "    <li>spam detectors detecting and stopping unwanted emails labelled as spam from reaching our inboxes</li>\n",
    "    <li>medical image analysis systems help doctors spot tumors they might have missed</li>\n",
